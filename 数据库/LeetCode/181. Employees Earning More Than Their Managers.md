求比对应经理薪水还高的职员。



## 方法一：

* 使用子查询，效率低

```mysql
select Name Employee 
from Employee e
where e.Salary > (select Salary from Employee 
                 where Id = e.ManagerId);
```



## 方法二：

* 自连接

```mysql
select e.Name Employee 
from Employee e join Employee m
where e.ManagerId = m.Id
and e.Salary > m.Salary;
```
