# [1-bit and 2-bit Characters][1]
> We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).  
> 
> Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.
>   
> **Example 1:**
> 
	Input: 
	bits = [1, 0, 0]
	Output: True
	Explanation: 
	The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.	
> **Example 2:**
>
	Input: 
	bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
	Output: False
	Explanation: 
	The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
> **Note:**
> 
> - `1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.
> - `bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.

给定数组中仅有0和1两种元素，且出现的元素组合只能有三种编码方式：10、11、0，判断给定的数组最后一个元素是否属于0编码。

- 题目的意思是要判断最后一个0元素是属于0还是输入10；
- 遍历数组，给定指针，若当前位为1则指针+2；若当前位为0，则指针+1；
- 判断最后指针是否与bits.size-1相等，相等则为真，否则为假；其中size=1的情况也包括进去了。

### Solution in C++：

	class Solution {
	public:
	    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) 
	    {
	        int i = 0;
	        while(i < bits.size() - 1)
	        {
	            if(bits[i] == 0)
	                i += 1;
	            else 
	                i += 2;
	        }
	        return i == bits.size() - 1;
	    }
	};
