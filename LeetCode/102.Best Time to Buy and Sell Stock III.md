# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III][1]

> Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.
>
> **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
>              Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
>              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## 方法一：DP

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int T_i10 = 0, T_i11 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int T_i20 = 0, T_i21 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int price: prices) {
            T_i10 = Math.max(T_i10, T_i11 + price);
            T_i11 = Math.max(T_i11, -price);
            // 为什么2在1下面，也能执行
            T_i20 = Math.max(T_i20, T_i21 + price);
            T_i21 = Math.max(T_i21, T_i10 - price);
        }
        return Math.max(T_i10, T_i20);
    }
}
