# [213. House Robber II][1]

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
>
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [2,3,2]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
>              because they are adjacent houses.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

抢劫环形街道，不能抢劫相邻的，求最大抢劫金额。



## 方法一：DP

* 与[082.House Robber.md](./082.House%20Robber.md)类似，但是复杂了一些
* 环形，所以应该想办法把环拆开，拆开后就可以利用上题的方法
* 首尾相连，无非就是两种情况：
  * 抢劫首，不要尾
  * 不要首，抢劫尾



```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0)
            return 0;
        if (nums.length == 1)
            return nums[0];
        return Math.max(rob(nums, 0, nums.length - 2), 
                        rob(nums, 1, nums.length - 1));
    }
    
    public int rob(int[] nums, int first, int end) {
        int pre1 = 0, pre2 = 0;
        for (int i = first; i <= end; i++) {
            int cur = Math.max(pre1, pre2 + nums[i]);
            pre2 = pre1;
            pre1 = cur;
        }
        return pre1;
    }
}
```
