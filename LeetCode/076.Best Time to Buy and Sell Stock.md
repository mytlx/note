# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock][1]

> Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.
>
> If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
>
> Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
> Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

给出的数组代表了一只股票价格随天数变化的情况，选择某一天买入，再选择某一天卖出，使利益最大。



## 方法一：贪心算法

* 扫描一遍数组，随着扫描的进行，min保存当前扫描过的最小的值，同时计算min和当前元素的差值，将大的差值保存

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int min = prices[0];
        int maxRange = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < min)
                min = prices[i];
            else
                maxRange = Math.max(maxRange, prices[i] - min);
        }
        return maxRange;
    }
}
```



## 方法二：DP

* 这个题在leetcode中标注的是DP，但是争议比较大。

* 摘选出有代表性的观点如下：

  * 认为不是DP：

    * > I do not understand why is this a dynamic programming problem. The above solution looks simple. It just uses two simple variables. It does not use any memoization or tabulations as mentioned on this link.
      >
      > This is the definition of dynamic programming as mentioned on this link:- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solve-dynamic-programming-problem/>
      >
      > All dynamic programming problems satisfy the overlapping subproblems property and most of the classic dynamic problems also satisfy the optimal substructure property.
      >
      > I do not see any overlapping subproblems here. We are just using the result of (n-1)th iteration in nth iteration.
      >
      > maxval(0) = 0
      >
      > maxval(1) = val1 - val0;
      >
      > maxval(2) = max( (val2 - val1) , (val2 - val0), maxval(1) )
      >
      > maxval(3) = max( (val3 - val2) , (val3 - val1), (val3 - va0) , maxval(2) )
      >
      > maxval(4) = max( (val4 - val3), (val4 - val2) , (val4 - val1), (val4 - va0) , maxval(3) )
      >
      > maxval(n) = max( (valn - valn- 1), (valn - valn-2), (valn - valn-3),..., (valn - val0), maxval(n - 1) )	

  * 认为是DP：

    * > This is an optimized dynamic programming problem. It doesn't need to have a tabulation to be considered a dynamic programming problem.
      > Look at the optimized solution for Fibonacci sequence question that has space complexity of O(1), there you also just have three variables without any tabulation.
      > In this problem what we're doing in each step is to throw out the previous maxval and just use the recent one exactly like other dynamic programming problems that have O(1) complexity.
      >
      > The recurrance relation is:
      >
      > ```
      > dp[0][i] = min(dp[0][i-1], prices[i])
      > dp[1][i] = max(dp[1][i-1], prices[i] - dp[0][i])
      > ```
      >
      > `dp[0]` tracks the minimum and `dp[1]` tracks the max profit.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int min = prices[0];
        int maxRange = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            min = Math.min(min, prices[i]);
            maxRange = Math.max(maxRange, prices[i] - min);
        }
        return maxRange;
    }
}
```
