# [518. Coin Change 2][1]

> You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
>
>
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
> 5=5
> 5=2+2+1
> 5=2+1+1+1
> 5=1+1+1+1+1
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
> Output: 1

用给定硬币找零，硬币数量不限，给出最大方法数。



## 方法一：DP

* 完全背包问题



```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int coin: coins) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {  
                if (i >= coin)
                    dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i - coin];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```
