# [695. Max Area of Island][1]

> Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>
> Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
>
> Given the above grid, return `6`. 
>
> Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

> **Example 2:**

> ```
> [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
>
> Given the above grid, return `0`.

> **Note:** The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.



题目描述：

给定的图中，`0`代表海域，`1`代表陆地，求最大的连通的陆地面积，只有上下左右四个方向算连通，斜向不算连通。



## 方法一：DFS + recursive

* 固定四个方向
* 连通面积等于 = 当前面积 + 旁边连通的面积

```java
class Solution {
    private final int[][] direction = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    private int m, n;
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0)
            return 0;
        m = grid.length;
        n = grid[0].length;
        
        int maxArea = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, dfs(grid, i, j));
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= m || c < 0 || c >= n || grid[r][c] == 0)
            return 0;
        grid[r][c] = 0;
        int area = 1;
        for (int[] d: direction) {
            area += dfs(grid, r + d[0], c + d[1]);
        }
        return area;
    }
}
```
