# [583. Delete Operation for Two Strings][1]

> Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of steps required to make *word1* and *word2* the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: "sea", "eat"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
> ```
>
>
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. The length of given words won't exceed 500.
> 2. Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.

## 方法一：DP



```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length(), n = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return m + n - 2 * dp[m][n];
    }
}
