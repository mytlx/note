# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals][1]

> Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
> 2. Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

计算让一组区间不重叠所需要移除的区间个数。



## 方法一：贪心算法

* 先计算最多能组成的不重叠区间个数，然后用区间总个数减去不重叠区间的个数。
* 在每次选择中，区间的结尾最为重要，选择的区间结尾越小，留给后面的区间的空间越大，那么后面能够选择的区间个数也就越大。
* 按区间的结尾进行排序，每次选择结尾最小，并且和前一个区间不重叠的区间。



```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.length == 0)
            return 0;
        Arrays.sort(intervals, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            public int compare(int[] o1, int[] o2) {
                return o1[1] - o2[1];
            }
        });
        
        int cnt = 1;
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= end) {
                end = intervals[i][1];
            	cnt++;
            }
        }
        return intervals.length - cnt;
    }
}
```
