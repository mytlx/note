# [547. Friend Circles][1]

> There are **N** students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a **direct** friend of B, and B is a **direct** friend of C, then A is an **indirect** friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.
>
> Given a **N\*N** matrix **M** representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M\[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are **direct** friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: 
> [[1,1,0],
>  [1,1,0],
>  [0,0,1]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
> The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.

> **Example 2:**

> ```
> Input: 
> [[1,1,0],
>  [1,1,1],
>  [0,1,1]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
> so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

> **Note:**

> 1. N is in range [1,200].
> 2. M\[i][i] = 1 for all students.
> 3. If M\[i][j] = 1, then M\[j][i] = 1.



题目描述：

* 好友关系可以看成一个无向图，例如第 0 个人与第 1 个人是好友，那么 `M[0][1]` 和 `M[1][0]` 的值都为 1。

* 好友关系可以传递，求有几个好友圈。



## 方法一：DFS

* 遍历每个人的关系，如果发现另一个人与当前人为朋友，那么将另一个人也遍历了，dfs



```java
class Solution {
    private int len;
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        len = M.length;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[len];
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(M, i, visited);
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] M, int i, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[i] = true;
        for (int k = 0; k < len; k++) {
            if (M[i][k] == 1 && !visited[k])
                dfs(M, k, visited);
        }
    }
}
```
