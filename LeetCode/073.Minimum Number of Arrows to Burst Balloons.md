# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons][1]

> There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
>
> An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Input:
> [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
> 
> Output:
> 2
> 
> Explanation:
> One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).

气球在水平数轴上放置，气球可以重叠，给出的数组代表了气球的位置，问最少用几个飞镖可以将所有气球都刺破。



## 方法一：贪心算法

* 本质上还是求不重叠区间的问题，与[072.Non-overlapping Intervals.md](./072.Non-overlapping%20Intervals.md)类似。

* 不过与其不同的一点是，[1, 2]和[2, 3]这种边缘重叠，也算是重叠区间。

* 解决方法与其基本相同

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if (points == null || points.length == 0)
            return 0;
        Arrays.sort(points, new Comparator<int[]>(){
            public int compare(int[] o1, int[] o2) {
                return o1[1] - o2[1];
            }
        });
        
        int cnt = 1;
        int end = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                cnt++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
