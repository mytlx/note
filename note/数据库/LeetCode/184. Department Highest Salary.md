查找各部门工资最高的人的信息，一个部门可能存在多个最高工资。



## 方法一：

* 最后面的in，一定要用两项判断，不然可能出现部门一中查找部门二最高工资的情况

```mysql
select d.Name Department, e.Name Employee, e.Salary Salary
from Employee e join Department d
on e.DepartmentId = d.Id
where (e.DepartmentId, e.Salary) in 
(select DepartmentId, max(Salary) 
 from Employee
 group by DepartmentId);
```



## 方法二：

* 利用not exists，如果该部门存在比当前工资高的，那么不要

```mysql
SELECT D.Name,A.Name,A.Salary 
FROM 
	Employee A,
	Department D   
WHERE A.DepartmentId = D.Id 
  AND NOT EXISTS 
  (SELECT 1 FROM Employee B WHERE B.Salary > A.Salary AND A.DepartmentId = B.DepartmentId) 
```



## 方法三：

* 跟方法一差不多，都是利用子查询查找出各部门的最高工资

```mysql
SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
FROM
	Employee E,
	(SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId) T,
	Department D
WHERE E.DepartmentId = T.DepartmentId 
  AND E.Salary = T.max
  AND E.DepartmentId = D.id
```
