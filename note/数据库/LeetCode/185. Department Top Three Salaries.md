找到各部门中薪水前三高的，薪水可以重复。



## 方法一：

* 求分组内最高的N个的套路，将表进行自连接，利用`e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId`进行分组，利用`e2.Salary > e1.Salary `比较大小，最后统计个数，如果当前薪水最高，那么没有比它大的，那么说明count出来的值为0，第二高，count值为1

```mysql
where 3 >
(
    select count(distinct e2.Salary)
    from Employee e2
    where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
    and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
)
```

* 代码如下：

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
where 3 >
(
    select count(distinct e2.Salary)
    from Employee e2
    where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
    and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
)
order by e1.DepartmentId, e1.Salary desc;
```
