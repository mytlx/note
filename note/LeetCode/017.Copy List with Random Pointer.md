# [Copy List with Random Pointer][1]

> A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
>
> Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**

> **![img](https://discuss.leetcode.com/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png)**
>
> ```java
> Input:
> {"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}
> 
> Explanation:
> Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
> Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
> ```

> 1. You must return the **copy of the given head** as a reference to the cloned list.



# 方法一：

* 首先循环一次，复制各个节点，并设置原节点的next为复制节点
* 再次循环，复制random
* 将链表拆成两条



代码如下：

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node next;
    public Node random;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        Node curr = head;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            Node copy = new Node();
            copy.val = curr.val;
            copy.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = copy;
            curr = copy.next;
        }
        
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.random != null) {
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next.next;
        }
        
        Node p1 = head.next;
        Node p2 = head;
        Node newHead = p1;
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            if (curr == head) {
                curr = curr.next.next;
                continue;
            }
            p2.next = curr;
            p1.next = curr.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
            p1 = p1.next;
            curr = curr.next.next;
        }
        p2.next = null;
        return newHead;
    }
}
```
