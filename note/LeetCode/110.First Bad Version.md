# [278. First Bad Version][1]

> You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
>
> Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
>
> You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
> 
> call isBadVersion(3) -> false
> call isBadVersion(5) -> true
> call isBadVersion(4) -> true
> 
> Then 4 is the first bad version.

一系列产品版本，增量叠加，找到第一个出错的版本。



## 方法一：BS

* 如果关系式是：`high = m - 1`，则条件是`low <= high`
* 返回值则是：`return low`

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int low = 0, high = n;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int m = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(m))
                high = m - 1;
            else
                low = m + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
}
```

* 如果关系式是：`high = m`，则条件是``low < high`
* 返回值则是：`return low`

```java
public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
    int l = 1, h = n;
    while (l < h) {
        int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
        if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
            h = mid;
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return l;
}

```
