# [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array][1] 

> Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.
>
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Given nums = [1,1,2],
> 
> Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
> 
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> **Clarification:**
>
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
>
> Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
>
> Internally you can think of this:
>
> ```java
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
> 
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }
> ```



去除排序数组中的重复元素，要求不能使用额外空间，只能在原数组上修改。



## 方法一：双指针

* 快指针寻找和慢指针不同的元素
* 慢指针下一个元素赋值为快指针指向元素

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int slow = 0, fast = 1;
        int len = nums.length;
        while (fast < len) {
            if (nums[slow] == nums[fast]) {
                fast++;
                continue;
            }
            nums[++slow] = nums[fast];
            fast++;
        }
        return slow + 1;
    }
}
```



## 高票方法：

* count保存的是重复的次数

```java
int count = 0;
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
    if(A[i] == A[i-1]) count++;
    else A[i-count] = A[i];
}
return n-count;
```
