# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II][1]

> Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
>
> **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 7
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
>              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

> **Example 3:**

> ```
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

求股票的最大利润，可以多次买入卖出，但是不能交叉。



## 方法一：

* 将每个递增区间的差值相加

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int min = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        int max = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] - min < max) {
                profit += max;
                max = 0;
                min = prices[i];
            } else {
                max = prices[i] - min;
            }
        }
        if (max > 0)
            profit += max;
        return profit;
    }
}
```



## 方法二：贪心算法

* 对于` [a, b, c, d]`，如果有 $a \le b \le c \le d$ ，那么最大收益为 $d - a$。而 $d - a = (d - c) + (c - b) + (b - a) $，因此当访问到一个 $prices[i] \text{且} prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0$，那么就把$ prices[i] - prices[i-1]$ 添加到收益中。

```java
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int profit = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            profit += (prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
    }
    return profit;
}
```
